I'll create a Python script using Pygame to animate a snake bouncing within a rotating pentagon, with proper collision detection.
Snake Bouncing in Rotating PentagonClick to open code
I've created a complete Python script using Pygame that implements a snake bouncing within a rotating pentagon. Here are the key features:

Snake Properties:

Made up of multiple segments with gradient coloring
Maintains a constant velocity with proper bouncing physics
Moves as a connected chain of segments


Pentagon Features:

Slowly rotates at a constant speed
Drawn with white lines
Centered in the window


Collision Detection:

Uses line intersection mathematics for precise collision detection
Calculates proper reflection angles using normal vectors
Handles collisions with all pentagon walls


Physics:

Implements vector reflection for realistic bouncing
Maintains smooth motion of the snake
Preserves momentum while changing direction



To run this script, you'll need to have Pygame installed. You can install it using:
bashCopypip install pygame
Would you like me to modify any aspects of the animation, such as:

Changing the snake's speed or size
Adjusting the pentagon's rotation speed
Modifying the colors or visual effects
Adding additional features like user controls?
